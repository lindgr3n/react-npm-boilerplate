# Boilerplate for creating React-component npm package with ES2015

Starter point for creating [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components that you can published on Npm.

* Bundled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Develop with Hot Module Replacement [(HMR)](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)
* Includes linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
* Testing with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/).

**Updated to use Webpack 3, Jest 21 and React 16!**

## Usage

1. Install module as global 
    > yarn global add react-npm-component-boilerplate

2. Create your template 
    > react-npm-component-boilerplate your-component-name
    
    * Or if you want to autoset links in package.json add username 
    > react-npm-component-boilerplate -u your-github-username your-component-name

3. Step into your created template 
    > cd your-component-name

4. Check **_package.json_** so that the information is correct.

5. Install modules with 
    > yarn

6. Start example and start coding! 
    > yarn start

___
### Extra
* If you want to run tests: 
    > yarn test 
* You need to write tests in `__tests__` folder or as `.test.js`.
* It you want to keep watch run: 
    > yarn test-watch
* If you want coverage run: 
    > yarn test-coverage
* If you want to run eslint: 
    > yarn lint
* If you want to automatically fix lint problems run :
    > yarn lint-fix

    Adjust your `.eslintrc` config file to your own preference.
